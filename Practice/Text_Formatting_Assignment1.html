    <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
    <p>
        HTML (<i>Hypertext Markup Language</i>) is used to create document on the <u>World
            Wide Web.</u> <i>It is simply a collection of certain key words called "Tags" that are
            helpful in writing the document to be displayed using a browser on Internet. </i>
        HTML was developed by <b>Tim Berners-Lee </b>in 1992.
