                <p>
                    <b>Barcelona :</b> Lionel Messi began his professional club career with FC Barcelona, 
                    joining the famous La Masia academy in 2000 and making his senior debut in 2004.
                     Over 17 years with Barcelona, he became the club's all-time top scorer, netting an 
                     incredible 672 goals and providing 268 assists. <br>
                    <b> Paris Saint-Germain (PSG): </b>In August 2021, after financial difficulties forced Barcelona to 
                    part ways with him, Messi made a high-profile transfer to 
                    Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). During his two-year stint with the French club,
                     Messi scored 32 goals and contributed 35 assists, continuing to display his 
                     world-class playmaking ability alongside his scoring prowess. <br>
                     <b>Inter Miami: </b>
                     In July 2023, Messi made another move, this time to the MLS, joining Inter Miami. 
                     By September 2023, Messi had already made a significant impact,
                      scoring 11 goals and delivering 5 assists, further cementing his status 
                      as one of the sport's greatest talents across different leagues and continents.
